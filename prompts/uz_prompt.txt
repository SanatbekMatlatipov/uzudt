Definitions and instructions for Universal Dependencies (UD) annotation for UZBEK sentences
(possibly code-switched with Russian or English).

Goal:
Given a sentence, you must produce a list of tokens with their syntactic dependencies
using the Universal Dependencies v2 framework and CoNLL-U style fields, adapted for Uzbek.

Core syntactic relations (Uzbek):
- nsubj: Nominal subject – the syntactic subject of a clause.
- obj: Direct object – the main object of a verb.
- iobj: Indirect object – secondary object (often dative-marked: -ga / -ka / -qa / -ga).
- csubj: Clausal subject – clause functioning as subject of another clause.
- ccomp: Clausal complement – finite or non-finite clause functioning as object of a verb.
- xcomp: Open clausal complement – non-finite clause sharing its subject with the main verb.

Modifiers and complements:
- amod: Adjectival modifier – an adjective modifying a noun.
- nmod: Nominal modifier – a noun phrase modifying another noun (often with case suffix or postposition).
- advmod: Adverbial modifier – adverb or adverbial phrase modifying a verb, adjective, or adverb.
- obl: Oblique nominal – argument-like nominal (often with locative, ablative, instrumental, etc.).
- vocative: Vocative – noun used for direct address: “Azizlar, …”.

Function words and connectors:
- det: Determiner – quantifiers, demonstratives, numerals used as determiners.
- case: Case marker – postpositions and case-like clitics attached to nominals.
- mark: Subordinating conjunction/marker – “agar”, “chunki”, “deb”, “ki”, etc.
- cc: Coordinating conjunction – “va”, “yoki”, “hamda”, “lekin”, “ammo”, “biroq”.
- conj: Conjunct – element in a coordination linked to another conjunct.

Structure and function management:
- cop: Copula – linking verb “bo‘lmoq” when used as a separate word (e.g. “Bu yaxshi edi”).
- aux: Auxiliary – aspect/tense/mood auxiliaries (e.g. “yuborib qo‘ydi”, “kelib turibdi”).
- punct: Punctuation – punctuation marks.

Discourse and pragmatic elements:
- discourse: Discourse particle – “ya’ni”, “xullas”, “ha”, “xo‘sh”, filler words.
- parataxis: Parataxis – loosely connected clauses, e.g. “Keldi, ko‘rdi, g‘alaba qozondi.”
- dislocated: Dislocated element – pre/post-posed nominal linked anaphorically to the clause.

Uzbek-specific notes:

1. Word order:
   - Basic word order is SOV. The root is usually a FINITE VERB.
   - Non-finite forms:
     - VerbForm=Conv (converb: -ib, -gach, -guncha, etc.)
     - VerbForm=Part (participles: -gan, -adigan, -adigan, etc.)
     - VerbForm=Vnoun (verbal noun: -moq, -ish, -uv).
   - In syntactic dependencies, the main finite verb should be the single ROOT.

2. Case and postpositions:
   - Case markers are suffixes: -ni (Acc), -ga/-ka/-qa (Dat), -da (Loc), -dan (Abl).
   - Postpositions (e.g. “uchun”, “bilan”, “tomon”, “tufayli”) are ADP with DEPREL=case, attached to the noun they modify.

3. Clitics, particles, question markers:
   - Yes/no question marker “mi / -mi / -mi?” is PART with relation “discourse” or “advmod” attached to the verb.
   - Focus particles like “faqat”, “hatto”, “ham”, “esa” are PART or ADV (depending on context), usually advmod or discourse.

4. Multiword tokens (MWT) in Uzbek:
   - DO NOT overuse multiword tokens just for rich morphology. A single orthographic word with many suffixes is still ONE token.
   - Use multiword tokens only for:
     - Fixed multiword expressions that behave as one lexical unit (e.g. some idioms).
     - Named entities like “Nyu-York”, “O‘rta Osiyo” can be split or treated as multiple tokens with flat:name if necessary.
   - For this task, prefer SIMPLE tokenization: one token = one whitespace-separated word in the given sentence, unless there is a clear reason for MWT.

5. Coordination:
   - The first conjunct is usually the head.
   - “cc” is the coordinating conjunction; “conj” are other conjuncts attached to the first conjunct or to the verb, following UD guidelines.

6. Code-switching (Uzbek–Russian–English):
   - You may see Russian or English words inside an Uzbek sentence.
   - Tag these with appropriate UPOS for that language, but keep Uzbek syntax:
       “Bugun meeting qilamiz” → “meeting” is NOUN, obj or obl depending on structure.
   - Dependency relations follow the main Uzbek clause structure.

UPOS tags:
Use standard 17 UD POS tags: ADJ, ADP, ADV, AUX, CCONJ, DET, INTJ, NOUN, NUM, PART, PRON,
PROPN, PUNCT, SCONJ, SYM, VERB, X. See UD Uzbek docs for morphology and features.

Output format (per token):
Return a JSON ARRAY of objects, one for each token, with fields:

- "ID" (number): index of the token in the sentence, starting from 1.
- "FORM" (string): surface form as in the sentence.
- "LEMMA" (string): base/dictionary form (for Uzbek verbs use -moq form when appropriate).
- "UPOS" (string): Universal POS tag.
- "HEAD ID" (number): ID of the syntactic head token. For the root, use 0.
- "HEAD" (string): FORM of the head token (or "root" for the root).
- "DEPREL" (string): dependency relation (nsubj, obj, iobj, obl, advmod, amod, nmod, aux, cop, case, cc, conj, mark, punct, discourse, etc.).

Constraints:

1. Exactly one ROOT:
   - Only ONE token must have "HEAD ID": 0 and "DEPREL": "root".
   - All other tokens must have a valid head ID between 1 and N.

2. Tokenization:
   - For now, assume whitespace tokenization of the given sentence.
   - Use one object per token, in order.
   - Do NOT invent extra tokens or drop tokens, including punctuation.

3. Punctuation:
   - Attach punctuation (., !, ?, etc.) to the main predicate or root with DEPREL="punct".

4. Ellipsis and incomplete sentences:
   - If the sentence is incomplete but still has a clear main predicate, use that predicate as ROOT.
   - If a final nominal has no clear head (like “Bu kitobni …”), you may attach it to the nearest plausible head as “dep”.

5. Repetitions and hesitations:
   - If a word is repeated (e.g. “Men men kech keldim”), give each occurrence the same head and DEPREL.

6. Output format:
   - Return ONLY a JSON array, no comments, no explanations.
   - Example for an Uzbek sentence:

Sentence: "Bugun men universitetga bordim ."

[
  {"ID": 1, "FORM": "Bugun", "LEMMA": "bugun", "UPOS": "ADV",
   "HEAD ID": 4, "HEAD": "bordim", "DEPREL": "advmod"},
  {"ID": 2, "FORM": "men", "LEMMA": "men", "UPOS": "PRON",
   "HEAD ID": 4, "HEAD": "bordim", "DEPREL": "nsubj"},
  {"ID": 3, "FORM": "universitetga", "LEMMA": "universitet", "UPOS": "NOUN",
   "HEAD ID": 4, "HEAD": "bordim", "DEPREL": "obl"},
  {"ID": 4, "FORM": "bordim", "LEMMA": "bor", "UPOS": "VERB",
   "HEAD ID": 0, "HEAD": "root", "DEPREL": "root"},
  {"ID": 5, "FORM": ".", "LEMMA": ".", "UPOS": "PUNCT",
